## TA Notified
### App Overview

This app enhances the management of office hours by notifying the TA when the session has started but the TA is not present. It calls the TA's phone number(U.S. phone only) and sends notifications via the BARK app. It also provides an admin portal for the TA to manage their office hours, and offers students a quick way to join Zoom rooms.

When students visit [this page](https://itpwebdev.jianqinggao.com), the system responds based on the current office hour status:
