## TA Notified
### App Overview

This app enhances the management of office hours by notifying the TA when the session has started but the TA is not present. It calls the TA's phone number(U.S. phone only) and sends notifications via the BARK app. It also provides an admin portal for the TA to manage their office hours, and offers students a quick way to join Zoom rooms.

When students visit [this page](https://itpwebdev.jianqinggao.com), the system responds based on the current office hour status:

1. **Office hours are in session and the TA is available**
    - Students are automatically redirected to the Zoom meeting.

2. **Office hours are in session but the TA is not present**
    - Students see a countdown displaying the estimated wait time and their queue position (queue system to be implemented).
    - The system automatically places a call from a US toll-free number to notify the TA to join the Zoom session.

3. **The office hour slot has been rescheduled**
    - Students are notified that the office hours have been rescheduled when they visit the page.

4. **Students visit outside scheduled office hours**
    - The system informs students that office hours are closed and displays the next available time slots.
